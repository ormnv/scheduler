Lab 2 - Scheduler 

The scheduler lab assignment was written in Java and consists of the SchedulerM (the main) and objects Scheduler and Process. 

To run the program, compile with javac

javac SchedulerM.java
java SchedulerM

The user is prompted to enter a valid file path for the input file located on the user's machine. For example, a valid path would be 

Example/example/example/.../Romanova-Olga-linker/input-1.txt 

Then then the program prompts the user to enter 0 1 or 2 for the scheduling algorithms. The program creates an output file with the required naming convention and shows the name of the file created.
